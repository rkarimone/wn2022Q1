Important note:- 
Please keep in mind that, while master-node failing, all the running VMs may freeze For the time being
& all chunk-server may need to restart their service.



To simulate master node failure, manually we can simply pwwer-down the master-server


After failure of master node, we will take shadow-master to work as master-node

On Shadow Master, Command:
sudo ip addr add 192.168.101.110/16 brd + dev enp6s18


Now change the personality from “shadow” to “master”. To do that, command;

sudo vim /etc/lizardfs/mfsmaster.cfg
PERSONALITY= master

Restart the master & cgiserv service
systemctl restart lizardfs-master
systemctl restart lizardfs-cgiserv


Now check lizardfs GUI http://192.168.101.110:9425






= LizardFS Master-Server Failure & Automated Recovery from Shadow-Master

If we want to automate this process we can use some shell script to make shadow-master as master-server when master-server is down.


On Shadow Master:

vim /usr/bin/shadowmaster-to-master.sh 		; add the following lines

#!/bin/bash
sudo ip addr add 192.168.101.110/16 brd + dev enp6s18
sed -i 's/= shadow/= master/g' /etc/lizardfs/mfsmaster.cfg

systemctl restart lizardfs-master
systemctl restart lizardfs-cgiserv

Save+Exit


chmod +x /usr/bin/shadowmaster-to-master.sh







vim /usr/bin/master-check.sh 				; add the following lines
#!/bin/bash
count=$(ping -c 10 -i 0.1 192.168.101.110 | grep 'received' | awk -F',' '{ print $2 }' | awk '{ print $1 }');
if [ $count -eq 0 ]; then
 # echo "LizardFS Master is =DOWN= @ [$(date)]" | mail -s "LizardFS Master is =DOWN= @ [$(date)]" nms@ydomain.com;
 nohup /usr/bin/shadowmaster-to-master.sh &
 exit 0;
